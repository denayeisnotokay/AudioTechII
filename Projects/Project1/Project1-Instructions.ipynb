Though we have only used Jupyter notebooks so far in class, your synth will be written in a Python file called synth.py. I have built base code to help you parse MIDI and start your CLI.

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Minimum Viable Submission\n",
    "At minimum, your submission should:\n",
    "- Successfully run from the command line\n",
    "- Parse a MIDI file\n",
    "- Generate sound using classical waveforms, FM synthesis, or AM synthesis\n",
    "- Apply an ADSR envelope\n",
    "- Apply an effect\n",
    "- Write a playable WAV file\n",
    "\n",
    "I encourage you to extend this for more fun (and extra credit)!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Audio Quality\n",
    "- Your final .wav file should playback without errors. It should be normalized to avoid clipping and must use the sampling rate set by the user. Minor clicks, distortion, or aliasing artifacts are acceptable for this assignment as long as they are the result of your synthesis choices and not coding errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Error Handling\n",
    "- You should handle errors under the same philosophy as HW1. Prevent/resolve those that are more likely to come up and give warnings for any conceptual errors (aliasing for example)\n",
    "- Notice that there is no error handling for improper input to the CLI. You can add some or you can just handle the errors in the DSP functions. A valid error handling approach for this assignment is setting default values with a warning if input is incorrect, or forcing the user back to the CLI.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Efficiency\n",
    "- You should try to make your code clean and efficient, however, we will not take off points for inefficient code.\n",
    "- For example, I built the \"song\" array in synth() by concatenating note to note. This is not ideal, however, for the purpose of this assignment, it is okay.\n",
    "- Try to stick with short MIDI files to avoid long run times. There is an example midi file in the audio files called 'example_midi.mid'\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Signal Flow\n",
    "- You can reorder the CLI and the organize synth() and gen_note() however you please. Just keep in mind what makes sense at the note level vs the file level. \n",
    "- For example, it doesn't make sense to apply FM synthesis to an array containing multiple \"notes\". However, it may make sense to apply reverb once the full \"song\" is constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Working as a Team\n",
    "- You may want to use Github for version control and group collaboration for this assignment. \n",
    "- Talk to Ryan or me for help on this. I recommend one group member making a new private repo with all group members as collaborators. You should start the repo by duplicating the starter code. I would not work with multiple people on your forked course repo."
