    "    **Hint:** in a similar manner to how you may have designed your delay function, recall the functions `numpy.zeros` and `numpy.roll` along with how to manipulate multidimensional numpy arrays (e.g., scalar product, summing columns with `vstack`, etc.) If you plan to try `numpy.roll` DO NOT use it in a loop for convolution with a real audio file! (You'll kill your memory), instead consider the `map` function. You may also want to check out the following function which is similar to numpy.roll but more efficient for this task: `scipy.linalg.circulant`.\n",
