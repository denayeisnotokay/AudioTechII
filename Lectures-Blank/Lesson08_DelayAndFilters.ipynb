The cutoff frequency of a filter is usually expressed as the point at which it is attenuating the signal by 3 dB relative to the pass-band. Thus if a filter’s cutoff is set to a given frequency, there will be a region within the pass-band that affects the amplitude of the frequency components of the signal. This region can extend as far as an octave away from the cutoff point. Therefore, in practice, the filter’s cutoff frequency is commonly set *beyond* the \"ideal\" cutoff frequency. This is especially true when trying to minimize timbral change of a signal due to change in frequency content caused by the filter’s transition region."
